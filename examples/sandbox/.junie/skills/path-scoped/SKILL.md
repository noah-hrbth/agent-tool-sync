description: Context-aware TypeScript helper. Auto-activates when TypeScript files are in scope.

When TypeScript files are in context, apply these conventions:

1. Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
2. Avoid `any` — use `unknown` or proper generics
3. Export types from a dedicated `types.ts` file, not inline
